                            <p>Greetings! I was born and raised in Viet Nam. I immigranted to United States when i was 
                            15 years old. I went to high shool here in San Diego for 3 three years. Then, I went to
                            community college for three years and UCSd for another three years. I graduated UCSD with
                            a bachelor degree in Biochemistry/Chemistry in June 2019.
                            <br>
                            I am currently working as research associate at HD Biosciences Inc. After working in the
                            researching field for about a year. I realize that research isn't for me; therefore, i 
                            signed up for UCSD Extension Bootcamp with a hope of getting a carreer change.
                            <br>
                            A little about myself. I am not really smart; however, I consider my self a try hard
                            person. I like to play badminton when I have free time. I also like to listen to music when
                            I have time to relax. This is one of my favorite song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXPfovXw2tw"> Back at one by Brian McKnight.</a>
